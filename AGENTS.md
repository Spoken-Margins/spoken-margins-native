# Agent guide

Spoken Margins is a native iPhone/iPad listening app (iOS/iPadOS 26+). Listeners play articles, PDFs and podcasts, record spoken or written **Margins** anchored to the source, and share Margins as `.spokenmargins` packets that another listener can import and hear at the right place in their own copy. The product owner is a systems engineer, not an iOS developer: explain trade-offs plainly and bring decisions, not options lists.

## Current focus

Replace this section when the focus changes; do not append to it.

- **Baseline:** Build 29, tag `testflight/0.1-build-29` (`fcc4974`), is the last shipped build (internal TestFlight, 2026-09-25). `main` points at it plus docs-only commits.
- **Working branch:** start a feature branch off `main` for Build 30 work. `anchor-reliability` is merged into `main`.
- **Goal:** shared podcast Margins land at the right place for the recipient. Device capture and placement are owner-validated on Build 29; remaining work and status: [docs/podcast-anchor-plan.md](docs/podcast-anchor-plan.md).
- **Build 30 candidates:** stream source context (#156), "Play this moment" (#159), jump to an unplaced shared Margin (#158), the one-handed reach pass (#141, #145-#149, #151).
- **Parked, reference only:**
  - `park/co-op-2026-09-24`: failed co-op attempt plus in-progress anchor work. Do not merge it; port pieces by hand. Its packets use a Margin kind this build can't read.
  - `codex/desktop`: macOS companion prototype.
- **Background:** why the repo was reset is in [docs/repo-review-2026-09-24.md](docs/repo-review-2026-09-24.md).

## Repository map

- `App/SpokenMarginsApp/`: the iOS app. `Gate1AppModel.swift` (~16k lines) is the app's central model and `Gate1RootView.swift` its main view.
- `App/SharedSources/`, `App/*Extension*/`: code shared with the Safari, share and widget extensions.
- `Packages/SessionKit/`: Swift package holding the domain logic. It is testable on macOS without a simulator.
  - `SessionKit`: sessions, Margins, models.
  - `SessionKitAudio`: playback adapters, podcast anchor evidence.
  - `SessionKitPersistence`: SQLite store.
  - `SessionKitSharing`: packets, import/export.
- `Contracts/`: JSON schemas, fixtures and product docs bundled with the app. `Contracts/docs/recovery-mvp.md` is the product boundary.
- `docs/`: durable product and architecture notes. `docs/archive/` holds historical process documents; don't treat them as instructions.
- `project.yml`: XcodeGen spec. The `.xcodeproj` is generated from it with `xcodegen generate`, and both are committed.

## How to work

- **One agent, one change at a time.** Don't spawn manager, implementer and auditor chains. Use sub-agents only for read-only research.
- **Small, verified commits.** Each commit is one logical change with a message that says what was wrong and why the change fixes it. The commit message and PR description are the record, so don't write separate handoff, audit or status files for routine work.
- **Branches.** Work on a feature branch off the baseline. Merging to `main`, pushing `main`, archiving, uploading and distributing are the owner's decisions; ask first.
- **Don't grow `Gate1AppModel`.** Put new logic in a focused type, in SessionKit when it can be host-tested, and call it from the model. In particular, don't add another "should the source resume" flag or another playback state machine.
- **Keep packets compatible.** Packets exported by a new build must import into the last shipped build unless the owner explicitly accepts a break. Only require a new manifest capability when the packet actually uses the feature.
- **Protect owner data.** Never reset, reseed or delete the owner's Library or recordings. Storage changes must let the previous build still open the database.
- **Keep evidence local.** `artifacts/` is git-ignored. Test output, logs, screenshots and recordings stay there or on the external drive. Summarize results in the commit or PR.
- **Don't record instructions as documents.** Owner direction lives in the conversation, issues and this file's Current focus. Don't append directive logs to docs.
- **Use GitHub issues** for bugs and feature requests: one issue per problem, with steps, expected and actual behavior, and the build number.

## Verification

Tests that pass while the app is broken usually fake the exact boundary that broke: audio sessions, players, file paths across app containers, network responses. Verify in three layers, and don't let a lower layer stand in for a higher one.

1. **Component tests (host, fast).** This is the default loop for every change: `.venv/bin/python scripts/verify-tests.py --plan fast`. It runs the SessionKit suite, contract validators and browser suites.
   - Write tests that can fail for the bug they name. Run a new regression test once without the fix and confirm it fails.
   - Prefer real temporary files, real SQLite and real AVFoundation decoding on macOS over hand-written fakes at the boundary being tested.
2. **App compile and app-hosted unit tests.**
   - Every app change: build for the simulator and device:
     - `xcodebuild -project SpokenMarginsNative.xcodeproj -scheme SpokenMarginsApp -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build-for-testing`
     - `xcodebuild -project SpokenMarginsNative.xcodeproj -scheme SpokenMarginsApp -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`
   - After switching branches, use a fresh `-derivedDataPath`. Stale SessionKit modules in the shared DerivedData produce false "does not conform" errors.
   - App orchestration changes: run `--plan app` (app-hosted XCTest in one simulator). If it stalls before XCTest connects, stop and report it; don't retry in a loop.
   - `--plan app` uses its own `SpokenMargins Test Runner` simulator, never the journey one. It removes the app's data there before testing and shuts the simulator down afterwards if it booted it.
3. **Journey checks.** Before calling anything ready, run the affected journeys in [docs/journeys.md](docs/journeys.md) against the built app.
   - The agent drives the simulator with computer use (real taps and screenshots) and reports what was observed at each step, including clocks advancing and which item or Margin is playing.
   - An agent cannot hear audio. Audible content, Bluetooth, the Lock Screen and background behavior belong to the owner's pass on a physical device.

The scripted UI route plans (`--plan ui`, `speech-canary`, `release`) are retired from routine use. They were slow, prone to crashing the simulator, and missed the failures the owner found. Use journeys instead.

**Simulator crashes: use judgment.** The real hazard is a crash flood: many identical system-process crashes within a minute, which spam the owner's screen with dialogs (once about 20 in 10 seconds).

- **Stop for a flood.** If you see three or more crashes of the same process within a minute, stop, shut that simulator down, and report. Don't reboot in a loop, and don't switch devices to get around it.
- **Continue after a lone crash.** A single system-process crash can be noted and work can continue. Keep going on the same simulator or another one, and mention the crash in the report.
- **Automated handling.** `scripts/verify-tests.py` records isolated crashes as warnings and stops only on a flood.

Status words:

- `implemented`: code exists.
- `verified`: tests and builds pass and the agent ran the journeys.
- `human_validated`: the owner used it on a device and accepted it.

Only the owner sets `human_validated`.

## Releasing a build

The owner decides when a build goes to testers. Once they say to upload, the agent may archive and upload to internal TestFlight testing:

1. Bump `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml` (every target), run `xcodegen generate`, and commit.
2. Verify through layer 3 and list anything not verified.
3. Archive (`artifacts/` is git-ignored):
   `xcodebuild -project SpokenMarginsNative.xcodeproj -scheme SpokenMarginsApp -configuration Release -destination generic/platform=iOS -archivePath artifacts/SpokenMargins-<build>.xcarchive -allowProvisioningUpdates archive`
   Check the archive's `CFBundleVersion` is the new build number.
4. Upload to internal testing only:
   `PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PATH" xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath artifacts/SpokenMargins-<build>.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist scripts/TestFlightUploadOptions.plist -exportPath artifacts/export-<build> -allowProvisioningUpdates`
   The PATH prefix matters: Homebrew's rsync breaks Xcode's packaging step. A warning that onnxruntime.framework has no dSYM is expected and harmless.
5. Tag the archived commit `testflight/0.1-build-N`, push the tag, and fast-forward `main` to the release (ask before merging if it isn't a fast-forward).
6. Delete the archive and export folders unless the owner wants them kept.

Give the owner a short test checklist: the journeys to try, what changed, and known issues.
